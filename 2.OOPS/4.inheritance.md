# inheritance and constructor
* scala supports single label inheritance

## inheritance example
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    class Animal{
      def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    val cat = new cat
    cat.eat
  }

}
```
* output
```
From animal class
```
## inheritance with private method
* Throws an error as methods are private
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    class Animal{
      private def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    val cat = new cat
    cat.eat
  }

}
```
* output
```
value eat is not a member of cat
    cat.eat
```
## Inheritance with protected method
* can be used with a class

## Constructor
* How to define a constructor
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    class person(name: String, age: Int)

    class Adult(name: String, age: Int, idCard: String) extends person(name, age)

  }
}
```
## override
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    class Animal{
      def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    class Dog extends Animal{
      override def eat = println("Eat,eat")
    }

    val dog = new Dog
    dog.eat
  }

}
```
* output
```
Eat,eat
```

## Polymorphism
* snipped
```
    val unknownAnimal: Animal = new Dog
    unknownAnimal.eat
```
* complete code
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    class Animal{
      def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    class Dog extends Animal{
      override def eat = println("Eat,eat")
    }

    val unknownAnimal: Animal = new Dog
    unknownAnimal.eat
  }
}
```
* output
```
Eat,eat
```

## Super method
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    class Animal{
      def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    class Dog extends Animal{
      override def eat = {
        super.eat
        println("Eat,eat")
      }
    }

    val unknownAnimal: Animal = new Dog
    unknownAnimal.eat
  }
}
```
* output
```
From animal class
Eat,eat
```

## preventing override
### use final keyword
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    class Animal{
      final def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    class Dog extends Animal {
      override def eat = println("Eat,eat")
    }

  }
}
```
* output
```
overriding method eat in class Animal of type => Unit;
 method eat cannot override final member
      override def eat = println("Eat,eat")
```
### use final on entire class
```
object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    final class Animal{
      def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    class Dog extends Animal {
      override def eat = println("Eat,eat")
    }

  }
}
```
### sealed method
* using sealed allow method to be overridden in same file but not in another files
```
package oops

object inheritance_4 {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    sealed class Animal{
      def eat = println("From animal class")
    }

    class cat extends Animal

    class Dog extends Animal {
      override def eat = println("Eat,eat")
    }

  }
}
```
