# OOPS

## Basic of class

### How to define a class
* Define class outside object
```
package oops

object oops_basic_1 extends App {

}

class person

```
* call the class method
```
package oops

object oops_basic_1 extends App {

  val person = new person
  println(person)

}

class person

```
* output
```
oops.person@3551a94
``` 

### Define a class with parameter
* Define class
```
class person(name: String, age:Int)
```
* Call the class method
```
package oops

object oops_basic_1 extends App {

  val person = new person("jishan", 25)
  println(person.age)

}

class person(name: String, age:Int)

```
* output
```
value age is not a member of oops.person
  println(person.age)
```
* Output is not displayed because you have defined the class variables without val.
* correct way to define a class and call it
```
package oops

object oops_basic_1 extends App {

  val person = new person("jishan", 25)
  println(person.age)

}

class person(name: String, val age:Int)

```
* output
```
25
```
### Define a method inside a class
* Definition
```
package oops

object oops_basic_1 extends App {

  val person = new person("jishan", 25)
  person.greet("farhan")

}

class person(name: String, val age:Int){

  def greet(fname:String): Unit ={
    println(f"${name} says,hi ${fname}")
  }
}

```
* output
```
jishan says,hi farhan
```

## Exercises
### Exercise 1
```
Define novel and writer class

Writer: first name, surname, year
  - method fullname

Novel: name,year of release, author
  - method autherAge
           isWrittenBY(author)
           copy(new year of release) = New instnace of novel
```
* code
```
package oops

import java.io.Writer

object oops_basic_1 extends App {

  val author = new Writer("Jishan", "Mr.", 1992)

  val novel = new Novel("Great Expectation", 2003, author)

  println(author.fullName)
  println(novel.authorAge)
  println(novel.isWrittenBy(author))


}

class Writer(first_name:String, surname:String, val year:Int){
  def fullName:String = surname + " " + first_name
}

class Novel(name:String, year_of_release:Int, author: Writer){

  def authorAge: Int = year_of_release - author.year

  def isWrittenBy(author: Writer) = author == this.author

  def copy(newYear:Int): Novel = new Novel(name, newYear, author)

}
```

```
Mr. Jishan
11
true
```
